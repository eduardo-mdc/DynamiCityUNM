# PI-DynamiCITY-UNM

DynamiCITY-UNM is a GIS-based application for visualizing maps and topology. Our application leverages the power of postGIS extension for postgreSQL to provide a seamless experience for mapping and geospatial analysis. We have built our application on top of the popular Django web framework, which provides a robust set of tools for building web applications.

With our application, you can easily load, manipulate, and visualize geospatial data using a web-based interface. Our application supports a variety of file formats, including shapefiles, GeoJSON, among others. You can use our application to create and customize maps with different layers and styles, as well as perform geospatial queries and analysis.

Our application is designed to be easy to use, even for users who are not familiar with GIS or geospatial analysis. We provide a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly get started with mapping and analysis. Additionally, our application is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs and requirements.
